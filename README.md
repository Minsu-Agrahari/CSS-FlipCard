How to Use 🚀
1. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
2. Hover over the card to see the flipping animation.

Code Explanation 💡
**HTML** (`index.html`)
- The structure consists of a **container** with two `.card` divs (front and back faces).
- The **front face** contains:
  - A header with a logo and chip image.
  - Card details including the number, name, and expiry date.
- The **back face** contains:
  - Customer service details.
  - A magnetic strip and a signature box with the CVV code.

**CSS** (`style.css`)
- **Container Animation:** Uses `perspective: 1000px;` and `transform: rotateY(180deg);` on hover.
- **Blurred Glassmorphism Effect:** Achieved using `backdrop-filter: blur(25px);`.
- **Responsive Design:** Flexible sizing and font adjustments.
- **Background Effects:** Gradient circles to enhance visual appeal.
